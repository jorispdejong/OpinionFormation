# Opinion Formation
This repo contains an R project that models the dynamics of a sociological reaction network of opinion formation using both Krylov Subspace Approximation (KSA) and Monte Carlo simulations with the Gillespie algorithm.
The simulations were part of an Mathematics Master's assignment, so for supplementary information about e.g. the KSA method, the Gillespie algorithm, or the sociological model, see the report.
